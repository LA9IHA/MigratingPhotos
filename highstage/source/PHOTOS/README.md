# Source album photos

Copy your photos here. Include directory structure you have at source
  
For Highstage, the directory structure is one level deep. Highest level is Workspace, then Document type (PIC), then Item number without revision and then the same with revision and finally, the photo file below. Both the full size file and the thumb nail.
