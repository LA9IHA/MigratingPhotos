# Content of the repository

This is a collection of scripts for photo album migrations as described under https://piwigo.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page

We assume that your initial Piwigo setup will require 

* One Piwigo server
* One computer you work on to modify the Python scripts to your need, fix data errors, copy image files from your old album or phone etc.

I recommend you download the entire Migrating Photos repository and place it on your computer. Read the wiki and inspect the python scripts. Select the stem of your migration process, wether that is Gallery or HighStage and rename the directory to transfer and delete the other.

Follow the instructions in the Wiki.
